Here is a list of the services provided by [Silex Labs](https://www.silexlabs.org/silexlabs/ "Silex Labs non profit organization") to open source communities.

The services provided by Silex Labs to open source communities are provided for free. To attend the events though, you might need to</span> [be a member]( https://www.silexlabs.org/silexlabs/join/  "Join Silex Labs").

## A flow of events

Since 2009, we have organized [events, conferences and parties](https://www.silexlabs.org/category/the-blog/blog-silex-labs/sl-events/ "Silex Labs events"), when a new version of one of our project is released, workshops for developers and decision-makers, and a lot more.

For example, for the AmfPHP v2.0 release, a really important event for the community lead by Ariel, [we organized a celebration party](http://community.silexlabs.org/sl-party/ "Soirée tec tec tec by Silex Labs for amfPHP"), with showcase and networking. We also organized a more formal [conference at La Cantine](http://siliconsentier.org/amhphp-reloaded-la-cantine-le-18-mai/). For this new version, we released a new logo, slides about whys and hows, etc. [A blog post has also been written](https://www.silexlabs.org/2389/the-blog/blog-amfphp/amfphp-2-alpha1/), naturally relayed by the community world wide.

We did the same for many Silex, Haxe and amfPHP major releases.

We write articles regularly when a project has a spotlight, like when [Silex reached the 100.000 download](https://www.silexlabs.org/135295/the-blog/new-record-for-silex/), [Cocktail v1 was out](https://www.silexlabs.org/130892/the-blog/cocktail-v1-0-sunrise-progress-report/), [AmfPHP has a new functionality ](https://www.silexlabs.org/132935/the-blog/amfphp-2-1-generator-is-out/)…

[Haxepéros](https://www.silexlabs.org/137940/the-blog/lets-haxe-a-beer-together/) are gathering organized on a monthly basis. And finally, there is a type of events which we call BCBG – another pun word in french, and in English it means [Business Challenge for Business Gurus](http://www.paperblog.fr/4505262/soiree-silex-chez-mediabox/). It is a good way to gather VIPs in a very classy place, with not more than 30 people, drinks and some food. We take our guests through an initiatory course, to discover the bright side of the business. We ask them to play the « what if » game and we try to shake their certainties, split in discussion groups after a general introduction. Here is an article about one of these BCBG events we held last year. It was about open source business models. Here are the slides for this event.

BCBG in partnership with [Mediabox training center](http://www.mediabox.fr/).

## Workshops and conferences

The WWX2012 is a good example of what we do for the Haxe community. We have made this event a celebration for the contributers and for the users, showing off to the prospects and prescribers.

Before, during and after the event, we have helped the community be organized and communicate efficiently.  Working groups have been opened, for [Haxe communication](https://www.silexlabs.org/groups/labs/haxe-community-meetings/hierarchy/), for the conference staff and for Haxe leaders.

Many blog posts and tweets have been written by the community and the communication group is still active.

This event,  conferences + great party, with 100+ people over 4 days was a challenge: book plane tickets, hostels, etc. for VIPs, handle day to day organization, live streaming, recordings, pre and post event communication… And what was the most important to us was to make an effort on the fresh aspect of all the visual communication around this event, because we believe Haxe needs to appear dynamic and trustworthy.

In 2013, we have also [a great WWX planned](https://www.silexlabs.org/137756/the-blog/blog-silex-labs/worldwide-haxe-conference-2013-announcement/).
