Dear All  
This post is regarding my personal experience with Silex. My hunt for a tool to create my own web site ended on Silex. I jumped over to google and started searching for a tool that could have some features like easy to use, mature and integration capabilities with several other third party tools/ frameworks, I landed up on this great open source tool.  
The best feature of Silex is its component based architecture. The User Interface is so easy that a novice user can start creating his own web site in a short span of time. I too went ahead and created my own web site and I am thinking of making it live. I would personally recommend users to try Silex once who are searching such tool to make their own web site. I am sure they won&#8217;t go anywhere.  
Thank you very much Silex. I really appreciate you!!  
Thanks and regards  
Pankaj
