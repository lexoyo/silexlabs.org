<p>I started to try Silex a few days ago, and this is my first post. Please be patient.</p>
<p>I tried Tutorial.Slideshow with oofComponents plugin. I can see the slideshow in the Navigation mode (? or Editing mode, with &amp;autologin=1#/start). However, my screen stays black when I click Open-html5-site button (with &amp;format=html).</p>
<p>Please let me know what is wrong with me. I appreciate your kind support.</p>
