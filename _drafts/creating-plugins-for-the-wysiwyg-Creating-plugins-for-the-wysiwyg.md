The silex Wysiwyg plugin is a Flex plugin allowing user to edit the content of a publication. As it is a complex plugin, it implements it&#8217;s own plugin system, allowing third party plugins to extend it&#8217;s posibilities. You can for instance add specific panel to edit a component that you created or add an entirely new plugin that will be displayed in the Wysiwyg UI. Through this document we will see how to add to add a plugin to the wysiwyg that will display a simple &#8220;hello silex !&#8221; text in the wysiwyg interface.
