<p>As stated in <a title="First article of the series" href="https://www.silexlabs.org/?p=179359">the first article about Silex v2</a> and in the <a title="Second article of the series" href="https://www.silexlabs.org/?p=179332">the second article about Silex use cases</a>, there is room for improvements, and several important functionalities are still missing, but Silex is ready for the first contact with designers.</p>

you must handle hosting<br />
- we had for Silex v1 and we will try to set it up for Silex v2, a partnership with a hosting company to provide professional hosting automatically plugged in with Silex - then the experience would be the same as with Wix or Jimdo etc<br />
- you can host your files on any hosting plan, even free ones - which is better than with free wix hosting because you will not have any limitations, but you have to handle the transfer of your files to the host</p>
<p>Static site generators, Jekyll, Middleman...</p>
<p>same<br />
static files for better security, performance, cheap hosting</p>
<p>different<br />
wysiwyg / drag'n drop<br />
for web designers and not only developers<br />
cloud based, no install</p>
<p>We want you, web developer!</p>
