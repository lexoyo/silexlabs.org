As stated in [the first article about Silex v2](https://www.silexlabs.org/?p=179359 "First article of the series") and in the [the second article about Silex use cases](https://www.silexlabs.org/?p=179332 "Second article of the series"), there is room for improvements, and several important functionalities are still missing, but Silex is ready for the first contact with designers.

open source, free as in free beer and free speach

&#8211; we had for Silex v1 and we will try to set it up for Silex v2, a partnership with a hosting company to provide professional hosting automatically plugged in with Silex &#8211; then the experience would be the same as with Wix or Jimdo etc  
&#8211; you can host your files on any hosting plan, even free ones &#8211; which is better than with free wix hosting because you will not have any limitations, but you have to handle the transfer of your files to the host  
Static site generators, Jekyll, Middleman&#8230;  
same  
static files for better security, performance, cheap hosting  
different  
wysiwyg / drag&#8217;n drop  
for web designers and not only developers  
cloud based, no install  
We want you, web developer!  
Google closure, a kind of jquery+jquery ui, more focussed on applications than websites
