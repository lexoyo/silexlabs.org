This plugin should be used with a so-called &#8220;JS Layout&#8221;, it&#8217;s not useful without one. There&#8217;s no JS Layout available on this exchange platform at the moment.  
The JSGenerator aims at implementing a basic SILEX runtime in JavaScript.  
To use it, you simply have to activate it like you would for any other plugin:

  1. Go to &#8220;Manage&#8221; in your manager
  2. Select your publication on the left
  3. Click &#8220;Plugins&#8221;
  4. Click &#8220;Activate a plugin&#8221;
  5. Choose the JavaScript Generator plugin
  6. Do not forget to save your changes.

Note that this plugin depends on the HTMLGenerator plugin.  
The HTMLGenerator plugin should be activated for the publications that you want to use the JSGenerator plugin with.
