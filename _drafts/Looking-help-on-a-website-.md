I came upon this CMS by luck and it seems wonderful what you guys are doing. Currently my website is in the stage Â that we need more front end designs and there is much to do in this respect.  
So, if anyone is good at designing like with logos, intros, (like for tutorials at the beginning of the site etc) and icons etc. I will gladly even Â pay for it. ðŸ™‚  
It&#8217;s a search engine for torrents and has a unique nature to this category of sites that I thought up while playing games. If you can help out and for more info on the project, contact me @ finalordertorrentts@gmail.com  
Thanks guys. =]

Also I cant find the forums on here for some reason and my email didnt get any activation key. The site here asked for one on registration. Also if you guys need donations on your project here let me know.
