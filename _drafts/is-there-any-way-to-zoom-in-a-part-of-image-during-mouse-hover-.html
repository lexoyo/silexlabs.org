<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have created an Image gallery using oof Components viz. DataSelector, ImageDisplay, RssConnector, ThumbList.<br />
When user selects a thumbList image, the full size image gets visible in the ImageDisplay area. </p>
<p>I would like to have a functionality in my gallery where if user hovers over the image (displayed in the ImageDisplay component) then that portion of the image should enlarge. As if the image is being seen though a lens.</p>
<p>is it possible to do it in silex over oofComponents? Please help.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />
Pankaj</p>
