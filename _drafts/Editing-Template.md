I Spent time editing the Visicard Template now two days later I can&#8217;t get into to it. The split screen button is not there anymore, I do not know how to get it back. I saved a file (so I thought) with a different name but can not find it anymore.Â  I am running the portable server. Any idea of what happened to the editor.
