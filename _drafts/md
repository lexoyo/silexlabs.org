Hi  
I have an iFrame (named &#8216;images&#8217;) embedded in a layer. A button added on the page should close the iFrame. I have added the action on the button as follows:  
onRelease hide:images  
but the iFrame does not closes. Can anyone help me in finding out what is the issue here.  
Also, I have two posts opening since 2 weeks but nobody is responding. is anyone there?  
Thanks  
Pankaj
