Modern Design Theme is a free corporate theme for Silex

This Silex theme has been made in order to test the beta version of Silex v1.6.3. I share it with you because it is very simple and easy to customize with your content.

I have found the design in the great article [20 High Quality, Extraordinary & Free Web PSD Templates](http://www.noupe.com/design/20-high-quality-extraordinary-free-web-psd-templates.html) by Kendra Gaines. It took me 1 hour to make it a Silex site, starting from the [psd template provided by the author](http://webdesignfan.com/free-modern-design-studio-psd-template/). The license of this theme is the same as the license of the design (which I could not find... hum).

Here is the [online demo of this great theme](http://silexprod.com/modern-design/), which you can [install from within your manager](https://www.silexlabs.org/silex/tutorials-silex/install-new-items-for-your-silex-server/) (after [downloading Silex](http://projects.silexlabs.org/?/silex/flash.cms/download)).
