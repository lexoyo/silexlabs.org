This is a big project, and needs to be financed. One option that is being considered is to make this a commercial project, outside of Silex Labs. AmfPHP would still work as is, but when you need a speed boost because a lot of people are using your app, you would have the option of buying this lib to increase performance.

Before starting work, we would appreciate some feedback from our users.

*   Would you be interested?
*   How much would you be willing to pay for it? On What terms?
*   We're considering the creation of a [kickstarter](www.kickstarter.com) project for it. Is that a good idea?
