_**This article exposes** **the vision we share with the Silex
      Labs team and several Haxe community members, about Haxe needs in order to expand _and to be sustainable_.
    **_




_Silex Labs and Haxe have a lot to share, and Silex Labs team has shown that we are
    willing to, and capable of taking care of Haxe, in the scope of our missions as defined in the organization
    statutes: help open source communities with communication, networking and training. _




_Our actions in Paris are documented in order to be replicable by other people in
    other places, for the same or other open source projects. _




**_We propose an action plan here, illustrated with examples of what we do for
      Silex and amfPHP. Some of the actions specific to Haxe, have already started._**




And we hope that many of you will follow us and support us.

## Context


The [WWX
  Haxe conference](https://www.silexlabs.org/132104/the-blog/haxe-wwx-rox/) took place last week-end, 4 unforgettable days. And as [@elimak](https://twitter.com//elimak)
said


<blockquote>"Long live the great spirit of the past weekend :)"</blockquote>


Here are several blog posts to sum it up, kindly written for you by the community:

Also you can check [the #wwx hash tag](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23WWX) and soon we will release the
pictures and videos, stay tuned [Silex Labs on

At Silex Labs, we are familiar with organization of parties or conferences, even with 100+ people, but we had never
done it over 4 days, with plane tickets, hostels, etc. We have made an effort on the fresh aspect of all the visual
communication around this event, because we believe Haxe needs to appear dynamic and trustworthy - and I quote Pol:


<blockquote>"Haxe is not that adorable young virgin you see in the ads, but a wild redhead woman who has much more to
  offer if you can handle it!"

  ![](https://www.silexlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/red1.jpeg)</blockquote>




## About Haxe and Silex Labs


The WWX event gave us the chance to show the community that our team is talented for communication and networking. And
these are 2 of the 3 [missions of Silex Labs](https://www.silexlabs.org/silexlabs/).

As you can see it on this page about [Silex
  Labs activities](https://www.silexlabs.org/silexlabs/#activities), we do a lot for our projects [Silex](https://www.silexlabs.org/silex/)
and [amfPHP](https://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/), and for Silex Labs itself - the organisation itself is a
project which also needs communication, networking and training. Since 2009, we have organized events, conferences and
parties when a new version is released, workshops for developers and decision-makers, and a lot more.

**This event, WWX, was also a way to show the community that we are willing to count haxe as one of our supported
  projects. Now it is up to you, Haxe community members, to act as Silex Labs members and help us make noise and shape
  the image of Haxe so that it will reflect the reality.**


## Organizing ourselves to act efficiently


Last monday, while some of the attendees of the WWX were sightseeing, we have set up a communication camp at the [IESA multimedia](http://www.iesamultimedia.com/).

[caption id="attachment_132370" align="aligncenter" width="300"]![](https://www.silexlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/AqnIWGoCAAAXEdp1-300x225.jpg)
communication camp[/caption]

The small team - Nicolas, Yannick, Isa, Lexa, Ronnie, JC, Cauê, Valérie, Pol and Jacques have elaborated an action plan
in the morning and started to work on it in the afternoon. As we said it together:


<blockquote>

>
> “Not for world domination but to make Haxe a sustainable project.”
>
>
</blockquote>


This plan includes several actions which we already do for silex and amfphp projects, and also things we thought that
are important for haxe specific case. Some have already been started during the WWX organization.

Silex Labs has a methodology/concept:




  * our actions are documented and formalized as processes in order to be replicable


  * we finance our events with government grands, and the sponsors in keeping with our ethic


**Once again, if you are willing to help us, this will be in the action! The ultimate success being people
  replicating this action in other countries or for other projects.**


## The actions, and the plan


The plan is to federate the community to make it a reality that Haxe is a viable choice for the developments in the
public and private sectors. For that we need to grow, to work on Haxe image and to be united!********

Now we have exciting things to do:




  * **evangelization and training**


  * **promotion and networking**


  * **documentation**


  * **the hunt for contributors**


The actions can be local or global, world wide or in our neighborhoods.


### Workshops and trainings


The point which is the most important in the medium/long term: set up partnerships with schools. We have to be part of
the students curriculum. It makes them able to prescribe Haxe when they will enter a company in 1 or 2 years. We
contact schools every year, and 5 of them said they are interested by amfPHP and Silex for next year, 2 of them already
have integrated Silex in their cursus.

We are willing to organize initiations for the beginners, and workshops for users, on various precise themes. We do
that for Silex, and we call this kind of events the [PTT
  workshops](https://www.silexlabs.org/events/ateliers-silex/) - which is a pun word in french but has a meaning in english, but this is not important. For each event
we practice our communication skills, with Silex Labs members, designers, developers, users and teachers...

![](https://www.silexlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/workshop-16-0211-300x99.jpg)

Each time, a schedule is prepared, with topics and instructions like [the
  one for this typical workshop](https://www.silexlabs.org/131479/the-blog/blog-silex/ateliers-silex-5eme-edition/).

We do one workshop per month, and it takes approximately 3 hours per month of 2 people's time. Plus the time spent
there, with our users, which is really really fun.












### Evangelization


The decision-makers are also targeted in our plan, with two types of events.

The showcase, a conference focussed on one project.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="300"]![](https://www.silexlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/5868478819_9214322320_o-300x200.jpg) The showcase of Silex to several decision-makers[/caption]

There is a type of events which we call BCBG - another pun word in french, and in English it means Business Challenge
for Business Gurus. It is a good way to gather VIPs in a very classy place, with not more than 30 people, drinks and
some food. We take our guests through an initiatory course, to discover the bright side of the business.

We ask them to play the "what if" game and we try to shake their certainties, splited in discussion groups after a
general introduction. Here is an article about [one
  of these BCBG events](http://www.paperblog.fr/4505262/soiree-silex-chez-mediabox/), we hold last year. It was about open source business models. Here are [the slides](http://www.slideshare.net/SilexLabs/bcbg-doc) for this event.

### Promotion


When Silex or amfPHP has a new major release, we do a huge party! Like this Silex

And we have smaller parties also to celebrate our successes, and meetings to prepare for the events.

We sometimes give a small conference for the release, like this one for [Silex
  v1.6 at la cantine](https://www.silexlabs.org/1902/the-blog/silex-a-donne-sa-conference-a-la-cantine/) or this one for [amfPHP v2.0](http://lacantine.org/events/amfphp-reloaded-la-cantine).

![](https://www.silexlabs.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/silexcarbon_format_blog1.jpg)


Finally, we are part of several French events, such as [Futur
    en Seine](https://www.silexlabs.org/220/the-blog/silex-on-the-scene/), [les trophées du libre](https://www.silexlabs.org/tag/trophees-du-libre/), and much more:














### Documentation


Silex Labs has been paid by a media group once, to produce the [120
  pages of documentation of Silex](https://www.silexlabs.org/silex/docs-silex/user-guide-silex/). It has been handled by Isabelle and Franck. We had to write, translate, and we
have been helped by several interns and trainees.

For Haxe, the idea could be




  * make documentation and translation workshops


  * to help library developers to write comments, and generate documentation out of it


  * find the schools among our partners who could make students help on this matter




### The hunt for contributors


After some research we have found 2 of the people who initially created the Caml language. And also those who are
presently maintaining OCaml, which much alive! We will soon make a [presentation
  of Haxe to these OCaml developers](https://www.silexlabs.org/?p=132314), who could be a new parameter in our equation. They have recently created the
non profit organization: [IRILL](http://www.irill.org/). And they seem really really interested and open. It
seems that they have suffered from their competition with Java and its agressive marketting, and also learned a lot out
of it!
