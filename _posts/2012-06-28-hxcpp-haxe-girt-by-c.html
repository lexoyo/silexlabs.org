<p>This talk covers the broad design strategy of the Haxe c++ back-end, and how this design effects the implementation. Some low-level details will also be discussed, which will imply some coding tips for optimized performance.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.silexlabs.org/132147/the-blog/hxcpp-%e2%80%93-haxe-girt-by-c-2/attachment/hugh-sanderson/" rel="attachment wp-att-132148"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-132148" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/hugh-sanderson1.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="100" /></a>Dr Hugh Sanderson - Lead Software Engineer at <a href="http://ddd.com/" target="_blank">Dynamic Digital Depth</a></h3>
<p>By day, Hugh Sanderson is the Lead Software Engineer at Dynamic Digital Depth, where he writes software for all types of stereoscopic 3D devices; by night, he develops with Haxe and is the primary author of the C++ back-end. Hugh started using Haxe in 2007 while looking for a cross platform development tool and by the end of that year he was working on the neash library for flash-like functions on the neko platform. In 2008, craving ever-higher frame rates, he started to work on the C++ back-end, which saw its first official release in mid-2009. He has continued to evolve the C++ back-end, and it now runs on almost all computing platforms that have C++ compilers. Hugh is also a principal developer of several Haxe libraries including NME, which replaced neash, to provide cross platform graphics and utilities.</p>
