Silex is the new Project of the Month on SourceForge.net, the centralized location and source code repository for all open source software developers. More than 200,000 projects are registered on the website and shared by millions of users worlwide !

We are proud and delighted to be the new POTM !

Here is an excerpt from [Lisa's post](http://sourceforge.net/community/june-project-of-the-month/) about Silex on SourceForge.net :




_The mid-year honor for Project of the Month goes to Silex,(...). The Silex project has been going strong ever since its lead developers met by chance 10 years ago. (...) Like many projects hosted at SourceForge, the Silex team is spread out all over the place. Ten members gave more than a month of their time recently to meet in Paris and work full-time — without pay — getting Silex ready for its next release. Talk about dedication! (...)_
