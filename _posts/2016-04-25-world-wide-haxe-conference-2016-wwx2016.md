**What is Haxe?**The Haxe Toolkit is like the Swiss army knife for programming. A compact, lightweight solution for an extremely broad range of problems.Applied correctly, the tools will allow you to cross barriers between platforms, programming languages and devices. You will be able to construct one solution that works across all your targets.Whether you want to deliver a game or app to multiple platforms, target different devices or consoles or write a backend for a web page  – with Haxe, you can do all of these things and more. Haxe has successfully been used for game development, web development, interface and UI development as well as art installations and maker projects run with Arduinos or Raspberry Pies. There is hardly anything you can’t do with Haxe.If this looks like something you could get into, you’re lucky! The World Wide Haxe Conference 2016 is not far away and we’ll be happy to have you there and help you get started.  
**WWXs**Since 2012 an average of one hundred participants has been attending WWX and more than 1,000 people followed the live video broadcast each year. The videos from the 5 previous editions totalize more than 40,000 views on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCfElmI39izfiumyHyehPDw).
