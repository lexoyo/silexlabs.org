A version 2, why and of what?
-----------------------------

In 2012 and 2013, web professionals have been involved in the definition and the development of the next version of Silex, which we believe is the next big thing in terms of open source website builders.

This new version aims
to: 
*   edit HTML files without programming skills
    
*   fulfill the common needs of the professional designers, and allow web developers to extend it
    
*   plugged into the cloud, and also standalone
    

Silex for who, and for what?
----------------------------

Whatever your skills are, Silex has many benefits for you

*   designers can quickly create the templates they need
*   editors can easily update their contents
*   developers can add as many functionalities as they want by using the script editor or their IDE to edit the HTML files generated with Silex
*   beginners can enjoy the wysiwyg mode which allows them to create beautiful websites without (the need to have) programming skills

In two years we have made 3 prototypes. And the third one is by far the simplest and the more efficient of all.

As you know, contributions are the key of successful free software. This first release of Silex v2 is very exciting. There is room for improvements, and for many great functionalities. So we count on web developers to give a hand, and on others to give time, ideas, bug reports, translations, questions and answers to form the documentation etc.

> Right now, Silex v2 is functional and people have already produced several websites with it. For example this [amazing "parallaxe" website by léo Francia](http://leofrancia.fr/argentine/), great designer, and not a coder.
