After two weeks of work, The Masked Koala has translated the French User Guide of Silex into English, for your convenience!

Right now, you can learn Silex
> [https://www.silexlabs.org/](https://www.silexlabs.org/)

This documentation will let you discover a lot of things that you do not expect I guess




  * Installation


  * Manager


  * Wysiwyg


  * Text editor


  * Actions and Accessors


  * Customize your Silex


  * OOF


And for the  developers, you will find technical documentation in the codex

> [http://community.silexlabs.org/silex/codex/](http://community.silexlabs.org/silex/codex/)

So  please, keep it alive and leave comments in the documentation itself,  right where every body is looking for answers (and in the forum too [http://community.silexlabs.org/silex/forum_en/](http://community.silexlabs.org/silex/forum_en/) )

Best,
Silex Labs team.
