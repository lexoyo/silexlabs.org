  <strong>Daniel Glazman</strong> is <strong>Disruptive Innovations</strong>\
  \ <strong>CEO</strong> and W3C CSS WG Co-chairman. <strong>Daniel Glazman</strong>\
  \ is a dinosaur of Web Standards and is at the root of the  semi-official trouble-making\
  \ unit at W3C, the \"glazou\" (a 1glazou rant being kind of a storm). Being one\
  \ of the only survivors to 12 years of CSS standardization, he was appointed Co-chairman\
  \ of the CSS Working Group in 2008. Newcomer to Haxe, he sees it as a potential\
  \ ubiquitous programmer's dream going far beyond the Gaming industry.\
