I started to try Silex a few days ago, and this is my first post. Please be patient.

I tried Tutorial.Slideshow with oofComponents plugin. I can see the slideshow in the Navigation mode (? or Editing mode, with &autologin=1#/start). However, my screen stays black when I click Open-html5-site button (with &format=html).

Please let me know what is wrong with me. I appreciate your kind support.
