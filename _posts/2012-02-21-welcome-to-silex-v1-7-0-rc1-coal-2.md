It's now official ! A new version of Silex has been released today :)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/render0511-677x380.png "Silex Coal V1.7.0")And what a version !

We have been working these last monthes to enhance ergonomy, to add cuting-edge functionalities and to solve most of the bugs.  
We also provide by default a theme (enterprise) and a publication (business card) as a starter kit.

**Here is an overview of the major enhancements :**

*   HTMLGenerator plugin is now included in the standard release :)  
    It gives you the ability to have an HTML5 rendering, which is mandatory for your sites to be available in mobile devices, such as iPhone, iPads, Android and more…

*   Addition of the “Selection Tool” which provides a simpler way to edit your assets on the stage. You can select, move, change their position on the fly in an illustrator-like way.  
    This is a key point for you to be even more productive with Silex.

*   Addition of the “Edition Toolbar” which allows you to add shapes and text in a really easily way.

*   Redesign of the toolbars which provides an even more user-friendly interface.

*   Redirect plugin enhancement to provide the ability to choose the default site version, either flash or HTML

Feel free to install this fresh version and “Coal” version, or update your silex server if you have one


And enjoy !
