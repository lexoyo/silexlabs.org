### Lexa did it !


Thanks to lexa's insomnia, Silex won 2 great screencasts.

Their topics are :




  * [the installation of the import pdf plugin and the download of an adapted theme](http://www.screenr.com/4bw)







  * [add interactions to a pdf publication](http://www.screenr.com/3bw)




A great initiative for Silex and it's community !

So, if you can't not sleep, make screencasts :)

_**Note :**_ Lexa used [Screenr](http://www.screenr.com/), a free tool that doesn't require any installation.
