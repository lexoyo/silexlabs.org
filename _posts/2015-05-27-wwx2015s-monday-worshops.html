<p>Workshop from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm</p>
<div> Jason and Juraj will be putting together a macro workshop during the Monday session at the WWX, to shine a light into this realm of dark magic!</div>
<div></div>
<div>They 'll be starting with a beginner friendly introduction and then build up to more complex examples, giving you both an entry point and an overview for this topic.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There will be a second part, in which we'd like you to bring in real world issues, such as:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>things you think should be doable with macros, but you just can't figure out how</li>
<li>code you have that is clunky, bloated, inelegant, relies far too much on reflection or is otherwise speckled with costly runtime checks that should actually be doable at compile time</li>
<li>tedious stuff that you see yourself doing again and again, but that you just cannot build a reusable tool for by means of other language features</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Whether you are having trouble to get started with macros, or there are specific parts you cannot wrap your head around, or you just want to deepen your knowledge, or of course if you'd like to see life coding go horribly wrong (can't promise anything, but Murphy's law is definitely on our side here), come join us on Monday - we will make it worth your time!</div>

<p><strong>Workshop Duell Tool - "How to develop frameworks with the Duell Tool"</strong> by <strong>Sven Otto</strong> and <strong>Rui Campos</strong> (<a href="https://www.eventbrite.fr/e/billets-workshop-duell-tool-how-to-develop-frameworks-with-the-duell-tool-17123398546" target="_blank">register</a>)</p>
<p>Workshop from 3:00 pm to 6:00 pm</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/gameduell/duell" target="_blank">Duell Tool</a> is a command line tool for setting up, building and running applications on any platform. It can also be used for other general tasks within app development. It is made in a modular way via plugins, and each plugin is separate from the tool itself. The tool merges the needed plugin on execution. The <a href="https://github.com/gameduell/duell" target="_blank">Duell Tool</a> will be presented at the World Wide Haxe Conference in Paris on saturday at 11:20 am UTC+2.</p>
<p dir="ltr">For this workshop, <strong>Sven Otto</strong> and <strong>Rui Campos</strong> from <a href="http://www.gameduell.org/" target="_blank">GameDuell</a> will show how to build and extend your own engine with the <a href="https://github.com/gameduell/duell" target="_blank">Duell Tool</a> and their (open sourced) standard libraries.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They will create a simple sound library as an example in the workshop, letting people contribute to different target platforms which should show how development works in a team with the Duell Tool.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Based on the number of participants we could also write another library in parallel.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Audience: Framework/Engine Developers</p>
<p dir="ltr">Notes: Participants have a Github account and admin rights on their own machine. Preferably Mac computers.</p>
