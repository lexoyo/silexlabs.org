<p>From now on the best way to get support with amfPHP is right here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.silexlabs.org/groups/amfphp/amfphp-users/forum/">https://www.silexlabs.org/groups/amfphp/amfphp-users/forum/</a></p>
<p>The reason for the switch is that the Silex Labs platform that powers the website is now stable and powerful enough to handle this and provide a better experience for our users.</p>
<p>As team lead for amfPHP I'd like to take this opportunity to give thanks to <a href="https://www.silexlabs.org/members/camille/">@camille</a>, <a href="https://www.silexlabs.org/members/pol/">@pol</a> and <a href="https://www.silexlabs.org/members/lexa/">@lexa</a> for their hard work in putting together the Silex Labs website platform. I'd also like to thank everyone who ever answered a bewildered user's plea for help on the Sourceforge forums!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/amfphp/forums">forums</a> on Sourceforge are still open, simply because there doesn't seem to be a way to disable them without making them disappear. This would be a pity as there is a lot of knowledge there for those who care to look. But but but, please post here from now on!</p>
