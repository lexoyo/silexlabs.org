Haxe is complex, an IDE is complex, and the truth is that a majority of FlashDevelop users do not understand how they work. There is a lot of magic happening under the hood, sometimes it just works and everybody is happy, sometimes it doesn't and you need someone to blame. Or to understand how it works.

In his  lightning talk **“You don’t know FlashDevelop – tips and future” ** he’s speaking about the lot of things that changed in the last two years with a strong shift on Haxe, high-dpi screens and maybe someday MacOS support.
