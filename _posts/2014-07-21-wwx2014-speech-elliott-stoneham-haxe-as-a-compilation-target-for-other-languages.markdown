## ELLIOTT STONEHAM




### Freelance software developer




Elliott started programming in 1974, he exhibited at the first Internet World Show in London and wrote the website that sold the first insurance product online in the UK. After working as a systems programmer into his 30s, Elliott spent two decades in IT and general management. Outside of IT, he has master's degrees in business administration and Chinese. Recently he has been tempted back to his programming roots. His current personal mission is to write a Go compiler targeting the amazing Haxe language.





### Haxe as a compilation target for other languages




I will recount my experiences developing a Go->Haxe transpiler ([http://tardisgo.github.io](http://tardisgo.github.io)). I will explain the good, the bad, and the ugly of using Haxe as the intermediate language in a compilation chain. I will signpost how others could use Haxe in the same way, and suggest how the language might be improved to make that type of use easier. At the end, I will ask for help to improve the TARDIS go project!
