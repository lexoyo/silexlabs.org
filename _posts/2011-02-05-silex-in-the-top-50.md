This looks promising for the next version v1.6.1.. (which will soon appears)

Along with the 50th position, there are some important things to be shared...

For those who did not followed the news, here is a short listing  :

*   A great wysiwyg which allows you to add your components in a new manner
*   A new automatic updater and installer for themes, plugins, etc...
