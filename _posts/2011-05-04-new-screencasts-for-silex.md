### Lexa did it !

Thanks to lexa's insomnia, Silex won 2 great screencasts.

Their topics are
: 
*   [the installation of the import pdf plugin and the download of an adapted theme](http://www.screenr.com/4bw)

*   [add interactions to a pdf publication](http://www.screenr.com/3bw)

A great initiative for Silex and it's community !

So, if you can't not sleep, make screencasts :)
