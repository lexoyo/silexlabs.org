A lot has been done since the beginning of the year. Many thanks and hats off to those who have helped out!

				- The beta of V2 reloaded is nearly ready.
				- We have a simple website up [http://projects.silexlabs.org/?/amfphp](http://projects.silexlabs.org/?/amfphp)
				- the old website has been mirrored, for nostalgia about pizzas and for reference [http://amfphp-v1.silexlabs.org/](http://amfphp-v1.silexlabs.org/)
				- the documentation is clearly not finished, but it's started [http://community.silexlabs.org/amfphp/documentation/](http://community.silexlabs.org/amfphp/documentation/)

				What's still to do to get to v2.
				- finish the documentation
				- start work on a more complete website. We have some ideas here, but it's at a standstill
				- reintegrate the service browser
				- write more tests
				- fix a few outstanding bugs, mostly in serialization/deserialization, as everything around it seems to be working smoothly

				On the side, here are some projects that could be of interest
				- the native PHP extension
				- Eclipse/Flash Builder integration
				- integration with your favourite PHP framework
				- more plugins, especially third party
				- writing a wikipedia page, an osflash page, etc.
