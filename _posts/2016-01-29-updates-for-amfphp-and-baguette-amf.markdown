PHP keeps on improving from release to release, as we have seen with PHP 5.6 then PHP 7.  [Amfphp](https://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/) has been updated to version 2.2.2 profiler to be compatible with the latest changes.  PHP 5.6 is now fully supported. PHP 7 is still very fresh, so please try it in development environments but exercise caution if you want to try it in production.

[Baguette AMF](http://baguetteamf.com), the accelerator for Amfphp, now supports PHP 5.2 to 5.6. Work on supporting PHP 7 is ongoing.
