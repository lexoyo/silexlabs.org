<h2>The blog</h2>
<p>The SilexLabs blog is an initiative from the Silex team with one aim : to express ourselves and share our experiences, discoveries and stories during this month of may and beyond.</p>

<p>We’ll refine the topics raised in this blog as we go along…</p>
<h2>The organization</h2>
<p>The Silex team members have decided to formalize theire cooperation by creating a non profit organization for the promotion, support for deployment and the development of open source software projects SILEX and Open Source Flash related.</p>
<p>The goal is to promote the software and its related projects nationally and internationally. We are an official training center with a state accreditation, and the maintainer for Silex and amfPhp projects.</p>
