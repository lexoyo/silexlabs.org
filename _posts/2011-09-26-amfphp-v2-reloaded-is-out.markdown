It's been a long time coming, but it's here.

The first release candidate came out in June. Since then there have been quite a few bugfixes and enhancements. A lot of this was in reaction to the feedback from the community, so a big shout goes out to everyone who took the time to help us make this the best release of amfPHP yet.

Get it here:

[http://sourceforge.net/projects/amfphp/files/amfphp/amfphp-2.0.zip/download](http://sourceforge.net/projects/amfphp/files/amfphp/amfphp-2.0.zip/download)

From the changelog:

AmfPhpGet plugin, for requests just using GET, and cross domain AJAX calls
config shared between plugins support added
switch to return or not error details, and support for custom error messages
service browser design
support for multiple plugin folders
plugins can now add services
