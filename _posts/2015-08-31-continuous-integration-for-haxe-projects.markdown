In this talk **"Continuous Integration for Haxe Projects"**, he presents how to set up continuous integration (CI) services, like [TravisCI](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci) and [AppVeyor](https://github.com/appveyor), to automatically test our Haxe code for every commit. He also discusses some interesting use of CI that could be useful no matter we are building games, mobile apps, websites, or writing novels.
