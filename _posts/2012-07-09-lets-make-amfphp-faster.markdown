A few months ago we added a feedback form for amfPHP to the website. [https://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/feedback/](https://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/feedback/) Thanks to everyone who answered. Please keep it coming! The most popular feature request is "c extension for AMF, allowing much better performance".

				This is a big project, and needs to be financed. One option that is being considered is to make this a commercial project, outside of Silex Labs. AmfPHP would still work as is, but when you need a speed boost because a lot of people are using your app, you would have the option of buying this lib to increase performance.

				Before starting work, we would appreciate some feedback from our users.




  * Would you be interested?


  * How much would you be willing to pay for it? On What terms?


  * We're considering the creation of a [kickstarter ](www.kickstarter.com)project for it. Is that a good idea?


				You can get back to us on this using the feedback form here [https://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/feedback/](https://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/feedback/), or by mail at contact at silexlabs dot org.  And please comment!
