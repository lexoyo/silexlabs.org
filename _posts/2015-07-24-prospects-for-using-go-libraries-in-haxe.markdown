#### Elliott Stoneham's speech at the Haxe conference WWX2015


**Elliott Stoneham** is a freelance developer. Elliott first discovered programming in 1974 and has been inhaling deeply ever since. He exhibited at the first Internet World Show in London and wrote the website that sold the first insurance product online in the UK. After working as a systems programmer into his 30s, Elliott detoured into IT and general management, gaining 2 masters' degrees in business administration and Chinese, besides raising 2 charming but errant children.

Elliott’s talk **“Prospects for using Go libraries in Haxe”** focuses on his current personal passion; the development of his [TARDIS Go](http://tardisgo.github.io/) -> Haxe project and the potential re-use of [Go](https://golang.org/) libraries in Haxe. With examples ranging from Unicode normalisation to image inspection, it is the only talk with speaking-in-tongues and nudity (not him).
