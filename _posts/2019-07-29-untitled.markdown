Hi

I have an iFrame (named 'images') embedded in a layer. A button added on the page should close the iFrame. I have added the action on the button as follows:

onRelease hide:images

but the iFrame does not closes. Can anyone help me in finding out what is the issue here.

Also, I have two posts opening since 2 weeks but nobody is responding. is anyone there?

Thanks
Pankaj
