For everyone that couldn't make it to the [online Amfphp meetup](https://www.silexlabs.org/event/amfphp-online-meetup-come-and-try-the-new-features/), here's the edited video.



The presentation takes about half the time, and the rest is questions and answers.

This was a success, and hopefully we'll doing more. If you have any suggestions on the content, format, time or whatever please comment below!

Thanks for being there and thanks for watching,
