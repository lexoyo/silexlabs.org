Dear Vimmortals “Let’s Vim together again!" and in english this time ;)

**To celebrate the coming of Felippe our official Brazilian Vimer and one of the founders of this Vim group, we propose to do the next meet up in english (as we used to do at the begining).**

The idea is still the
same: to allow everyone to show their own way to use Vim with the length of your choice (between 5 and 20 minutes). Do not hesitate to contact us to propose a "lightning talk" on your use of Vim (contact (at) silexlabs (dot) org).

**Program**

a round table discussion on Vim where everyone can make demos of his favorite plugins and configuration(s) that make Vim unique in your heart.

**Date / Location/ Registration  
**

Monday, August 6th from 19h-21h Mediabox.

[Register now for free!](http://www.meetup.com/Vim-Paris/events/224285284/)

**Target**

Developers already using Vim or really wanting to

**Equipment**

Computers will be available on site, but if you want to show us your config bring yours.
