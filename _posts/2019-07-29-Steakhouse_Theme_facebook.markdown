Steakhouse Theme facebook is a free theme for Silex

use it with: Static Html iframe tabs

I have found the design here: "Free Website Templates by: www.freewebsitetemplates.com"

This Silex theme has been made in order to test the version of Silex v1.7.0RC1 in corporate identity for your page and facebook.
I share it with you because it is very simple and easy to customize with your content.

Seems to run on any modern browser, also mobil.

The license/terms of use for this theme is the same as the license/terms of use form www.freewebsitetemplates.com!
