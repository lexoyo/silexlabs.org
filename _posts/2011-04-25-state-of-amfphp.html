<p>A lot has been done since the beginning of the year. Many thanks and hats off to those who have helped out!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.silexlabs.org/2011/04/state-of-amfphp/amf_logo1-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-2591"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2591" title="amf_logo1" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/amf_logo1-300x145.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="145" /></a></p>
<p>- The beta of V2 reloaded is nearly ready.<br />
- We have a simple website up <a href="http://projects.silexlabs.org/?/amfphp">http://projects.silexlabs.org/?/amfphp</a><br />
- the old website has been mirrored, for nostalgia about pizzas and for reference <a href="http://amfphp-v1.silexlabs.org/">http://amfphp-v1.silexlabs.org/</a><br />
- the documentation is clearly not finished, but it's started <a href="http://community.silexlabs.org/amfphp/documentation/">http://community.silexlabs.org/amfphp/documentation/</a></p>
<p>What's still to do to get to v2.<br />
- finish the documentation<br />
- start work on a more complete website. We have some ideas here, but it's at a standstill<br />
- reintegrate the service browser<br />
- write more tests<br />
- fix a few outstanding bugs, mostly in serialization/deserialization, as everything around it seems to be working smoothly</p>
<p>On the side, here are some projects that could be of interest<br />
- the native PHP extension<br />
- Eclipse/Flash Builder integration<br />
- integration with your favourite PHP framework<br />
- more plugins, especially third party<br />
- writing a wikipedia page, an osflash page, etc.</p>
<p>If you feel like you could help, or a comment, or idea, please give us a shout!</p>
