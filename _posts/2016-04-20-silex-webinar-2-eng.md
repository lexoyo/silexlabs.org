### **About Silex**

As you probably know, Silex is the only free website builder. Since 2009, designers, entrepreneurs, web developers use Silex to create professional showcase websites, starting from a blank page or on the basis of sample provided free templates.

Behind Silex, there’s a non profit organization, Silex Labs, that ensures Silex is still free, that it respects your privacy and web standards. On the other hand we use Silex to introduce beginners to the web business, Silex being  a source of motivation and a tool to fight the digital divide.

In order to improve Silex we [launch a crowdfunding campaign](https://www.ulule.com/silex-websitebuilder/) in April 2016.
