    Did you know? There is a newsletter to keep up with Silex latest news, <a href="http://eepurl.com/bWFgmT">subscribe to Silex news letter (less than 1 email per month)</a>.




## Dashboard


Here is the new dasboard, which shows up when you open Silex ([try it here on editor.silex.me](https://editor.silex.me/)).

In the dashboard you can do these actions:




  * Open an existing website, either by importing it from a cloud storage or by selecting it in the list of recent websites you have opened


  * Select a "blank layout" _help wanted, give a description_


  * Select a template and start adding your content in a pre-made, ready to use website


Read [the docs on the Dashboard here](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/wiki/Dashboard).

The Dashboard looks like this:

## Sections


Here is the documentation on [Silex building blocks: the different types of elements](https://github.com/silexlabs/Silex/wiki/Silex-Elements). You will notice a new element type, the section.

Sections make it possible to do the following




  * header/footer pattern


  * stripes layouts like [in these great website designs](http://www.land-of-web.com/inspiration/web-design/eye-catching-website-designs-based-on-horizontal-stripe-layout.html)


  * hero images (see [wikipedia definition of hero images here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_image))


  * websites with pages of different height


  * rearrange content (move sections up/down with keyboard arrow keys)
