He is the founder of **[FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org/)**. FlashDevelop is free and open source IDE for development of Adobe Flash websites, web applications, desktop applications and video games. The primary purpose of FlashDevelop is enabling developers to edit, compile, debug and publish a Flash ActionScript project. It supports ActionScript 2.0, ActionScript 3.0, [Haxe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haxe) and other upcoming languages.

Haxe is complex, an IDE is complex, and the truth is that a majority of FlashDevelop users do not understand how they work. There is a lot of magic happening under the hood, sometimes it just works and everybody is happy, sometimes it doesn't and you need someone to blame. Or to understand how it works.

In his  lightning talk **“You don’t know FlashDevelop – tips and future” ** he’s speaking about the lot of things that changed in the last two years with a strong shift on Haxe, high-dpi screens and maybe someday MacOS support.
