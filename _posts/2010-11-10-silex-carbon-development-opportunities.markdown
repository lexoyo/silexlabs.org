Dear Silex developers,

				As you certainly know, **Silex core team have had 6 months of development** paid by a French group, in order to work full time on Silex **ergonomics, optimization and standardization**. And the non profit organization **Silex Labs has followed the move** and did a great job for communication and documentation: **[new sites](http://projects.silexlabs.org/?/silex), [events](https://www.silexlabs.org/2010/10/silex-a-donne-sa-conference-a-la-cantine/), badges, [themes](https://www.silexlabs.org/?cat=6), [plugins](https://www.silexlabs.org/?cat=38), etc.**

				**So we have launched Silex v1.6.0 three weeks ago****, with a new plugin system, for developers to develop with a WordPress inspired API.** The exchange platform let you distribute your plugins for free and offers you **a door into the user's manager**.

				Now we are looking for developers to make plugins in **php, javascript, AS2, AS3 Flash/Flex and haXe**. For now there is a small [documentation about plugin creation](http://community.silexlabs.org/silex/codex/?page_id=10) and [several examples on the exchange platform](https://www.silexlabs.org/?cat=38).

				You can make tools for the editing of websites, such as align tool box, ruler, etc. in Flex or in javascript. You can develop server side plugins for statistics, redirection, etc. in php. The visual plugins, such as contact form, carousel, etc. are in AS2. There are plugins in the manager, which are made of php and javascript.

				In particular, we think that two plugins are really missing, and we would like to help you with it:




  * - **translation plugin**, in order to 	replace the old translation interface of Silex. It is supposed to 	provide anyone a simple way to translate a plugin, or Silex itself. 	We already have set up an API for the manipulation of translation 	files, so this development is about javascript and HTML mainly.


  * - **PDF import plugin**. Since there is 	a Flip Book animation layout on the exchange platform, this would be 	great to be able to upload a PDF file and then convert it into a 	Silex Flip Book or site, automatically, from the manager. This is 	about php and HTML and it could take some Flex or javascript also. 	We provide the classes used to read and write the Silex layers into 	XML, and there is already a prototype running with SwfTools but it 	has no visual interface and it is not a Silex plugin yet.


				**So, people, it is the right time to learn about Silex plugins, and we are willing to help you with this.** Please contact Silex Labs with a proposal or questions: contact [at] silexlabs.org

				Best,

				Silex Core team.
