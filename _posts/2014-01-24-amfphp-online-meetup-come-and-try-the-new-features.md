[Amfphp 2.2 Profiler is now available](https://www.silexlabs.org/200755/the-blog/amfphp-2-2-profiler-released/ "Amfphp 2.2 Profiler Released"), hopefully youâ€™ve recovered form your end of year celebrations, and now Silex Labs is proud to present the first Amfphp online event!

The idea here is to allow our users
to: 
*   learn about the new features
*   meet the team and the community behind the product
