A lot has been done since the beginning of the year. Many thanks and hats off to those who have helped out!

- The beta of V2 reloaded is nearly ready.  




What's still to do to get to v2.  
- finish the documentation  
- start work on a more complete website. We have some ideas here, but it's at a standstill  
- reintegrate the service browser  
- write more tests  
- fix a few outstanding bugs, mostly in serialization/deserialization, as everything around it seems to be working smoothly

On the side, here are some projects that could be of interest  
- the native PHP extension  
- Eclipse/Flash Builder integration  
- integration with your favourite PHP framework  
- more plugins, especially third party  
- writing a wikipedia page, an osflash page, etc.

If you feel like you could help, or a comment, or idea, please give us a shout!
