It's been a long time coming, but it's here.

The first release candidate came out in June. Since then there have been quite a few bugfixes and enhancements. A lot of this was in reaction to the feedback from the community, so a big shout goes out to everyone who took the time to help us make this the best release of amfPHP yet.
