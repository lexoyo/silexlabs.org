Google Analytics is a free service offered by Google that generates detailed statistics about the visitors to a website.

A Google Analytics plugin has been developped for Silex and will see in this tutorial how to use it.

_**Note :**_ you can install and parameter your google analytics plugin locally, but you will obtain the google statistics only if your site (your publication) is online.
