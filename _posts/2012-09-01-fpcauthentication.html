<div id="LC45">FPCAuthentication is an AMFPHP plugin that manages authentication of user with a login</div>
<div id="LC46">and a password. The plugin offers two ways to authenticate, a basic and a elaborate one.</div>
<div id="LC47"></div>
<div id="LC48">The basic method is a simple call to the server with the user login and its secret value</div>
<div id="LC49">(generally a digest of a password) and the server grants or rejects the access according</div>
<div id="LC50">to these two values. This method is simple but not 100% secured if not used over a secured</div>
<div id="LC51">connection (a https connection) since message can be intercepted and even if a digest of</div>
<div id="LC52">the password is sent, this digest is the password for the server.</div>
<div id="LC53"></div>
<div id="LC54">The elaborate method is an exchange of 4 messages between the server and the client.</div>
<div id="LC55">The secret of the user is never sent explicitly nor a direct digest of it. This method</div>
<div id="LC56">allows the authentication of the user on the server but also the authentication of the</div>
<div id="LC57">server on the client side. Also, it provides a random password only known by the client</div>
<div id="LC58">and the server and only valid as long as the user does not logout. This temporary password</div>
<div id="LC59">can be used to send sensible data to the server without compromising the user password.</div>
<div></div>
