categories: ["Themes"]

This is the theme used for the silex launcher (the .exe version of Silex). It is a good example of a desktop application made with Silex, and the [ZincDesktop](https://www.silexlabs.org/81290/exchange/exchange-silex/plugins/zincdesktop-plugin-your-silex-publications-on-the-desktop/)[ plugin for Silex](https://www.silexlabs.org/81290/exchange/exchange-silex/plugins/zincdesktop-plugin-your-silex-publications-on-the-desktop/).

Unlike the [desktop widgets made with Silex](https://www.silexlabs.org/1705/the-blog/build-the-widget-of-your-dreams/), the desktop applications have full access to the user operating system through the [Zinc API](http://www.multidmedia.com/support/livedocs/), which you can use with Silex very simple actions, see [ZincDesktop](https://www.silexlabs.org/81290/exchange/exchange-silex/plugins/zincdesktop-plugin-your-silex-publications-on-the-desktop/)[ plugin for Silex](https://www.silexlabs.org/81290/exchange/exchange-silex/plugins/zincdesktop-plugin-your-silex-publications-on-the-desktop/) for more details.

The first version of this "Silex quick launcher" applications was made by [Silex Labs](https://www.silexlabs.org/) and [Mediabox](http://flash.mediabox.fr/) together, so that Silex can be run from a USB stick.
