This is the theme used for the silex launcher (the .exe version of Silex). It is a good example of a desktop application made with Silex, and the [ZincDesktop](https://www.silexlabs.org/81290/exchange/exchange-silex/plugins/zincdesktop-plugin-your-silex-publications-on-the-desktop/)[ plugin for Silex](https://www.silexlabs.org/81290/exchange/exchange-silex/plugins/zincdesktop-plugin-your-silex-publications-on-the-desktop/).
