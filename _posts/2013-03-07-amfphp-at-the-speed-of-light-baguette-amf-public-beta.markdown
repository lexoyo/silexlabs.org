[The AmfPHP community has repeatedly asked for a performance boosting PHP extension.](https://www.silexlabs.org/133635/the-blog/lets-make-amfphp-faster/)

[More Speed!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lauri_vain/2702725005/sizes/z/in/photostream/)


Ariel Sommeria-Klein, team lead for AmfPHP, therefore created [Baguette AMF](http://baguetteamf.com/), a project associating a PHP extension for parsing AMF natively, and a plugin for seamless integration with AmfPHP.

The tagline is **_AmfPHP at the Speed of Light _**as Baguette AMF makes AmfPHP up to 20 times faster.

It is now in **public beta**, so please try it out!

Please note that this is a commercial project and therefore not directly associated with Silex Labs.
