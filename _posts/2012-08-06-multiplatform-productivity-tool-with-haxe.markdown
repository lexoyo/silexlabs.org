What would you use if you had to deliver an animation heavy, interactive application to the the Android OS, Apple iOS as well as to PCs and a dozen different browsers? Adobe has got it’s own answer. Unity3d has their own answer. But what if your code base was 100,000 lines and you wanted to include javascript? Is Haxe the right answer?
