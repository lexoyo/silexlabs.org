=====================================================================

If you didn’t already know about this, Silex Labs organized the World Wide Haxe Conference 2015 aka WWX2015, the international conference on [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) the free cross-platform language from the 29th May to the 1st of June 2015.

We’d like to thanks once again [Mozilla Paris](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/spaces/paris/) for hosting us so well in his magnificent building, symbol of the free software development!

The WWX2015 brought together about 100 participants from 17 countries for 4 days of conferences and workshops and the famous Silex Labs festive evenings.

More than 1500 people followed the live stream of the conference on air.mozilla.org and on the official website [wwx.silexlabs.org](http://wwx.silexlabs.org/). All of these people didn’t just sit there and watch, they also shout to the world their love for Haxe, with nearly 1800 tweets between Saturday and Sunday and a lot of photos. A true great community!

Aside from the official talks and workshops, it was a great opportunity to create interactions between the members of the community by visiting paris, partying in a french bistro and having a croissant with your coffee every morning.

We are open to your suggestions to enable us to continue to organize this event, which seems so important to the Haxe community. Next year, we’d like to include all of the good wills sooner so they’ll have a chance to bring new ideas from the beginning.
