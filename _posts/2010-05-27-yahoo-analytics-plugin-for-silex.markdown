This is a yahoo web analytics plugin.

Yahoo Web Analytics (YWA) was made available to Yahooâ€™s search and display advertisers who are supported by dedicated Yahoo account teams, after Yahoo acquired web analytics software IndexTools.


### INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


To install it, drop the yahoo_analytics folder in the silex /plugins folder.

You can activate it for a specific site or for the entire Silex server (for all sites hosted by your Silex server) through the Silex manager.
