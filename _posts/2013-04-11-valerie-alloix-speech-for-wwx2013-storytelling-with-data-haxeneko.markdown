Her talk's title for the wwx2013 is "Storytelling with data + Haxe/Neko" and you'll find below a short description.

The main goal of data visualization is its ability to communicate information clearly and effectively. In the past few years, a lot of interests was given to developing tools, defining standards and creating API to enable a full access to any data to everyone. Unfortunately, there is still a huge amount of resource that is not published under these criterias but distributed as downloadable files (json, xml, csv, excel...).

What can you do when your data file exceed 10 GigaBytes or when you have to deal with complex spreadsheets with 15 sheets of 25 columns by 200 rows.

There is no way you can read the data directly (or even open the files sometimes) and yet, before throwing hours into your visualization, you must make sure that your dataset contains relevant information and you need to find a way to dig into the content “quickly”.

Because of it’s amazing speed on reading, processing and writing text based files, Haxe/Neko is of great assistance to do this preliminary job. In my session, I will show you how I used Haxe/Neko to extract relevant data and prepare essential resources for my data­visualizations.
