(friday: social activities; saturday &
sunday: conference;
monday: workshops), live streaming, a recorded version put online after the conference, welcome aperitif, sunday brunch and open bar saturday night party. Thanks everyone!

Haxe continues to grow and in the talk **“Haxe today and tomorrow” Nicolas Cannasse** will present the latest changes that were introduced in Haxe as well as **[Haxe Foundation](http://haxe.org/foundation/)** plans for the future.

The c++ backend saw changes too in the last year. **Hugh Sanderson**, in his talk


Haxe targets a lot of languages, but what about targeting Haxe? That's what **Elliott Stoneham** do in his [TARDIS Go](https://github.com/tardisgo) -> Haxe project and in his lightning talk **“Prospects for using Go libraries in Haxe”** he'll talk about the potential re-use of Go libraries in Haxe with examples ranging from Unicode normalisation to image inspection, he can promise you probably the only talk with speaking-in-tongues and nudity (not him).



Or maybe you’d like to or already use [FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org/), then like the majority of users you probably don’t know how it works, there is a lot of magic happening under the hood. In **Philippe Elsass**’ lightning talk **“You don't know FlashDevelop - tips and future”** he’ll speak about the lot of things that changed in the last two years with a strong shift on Haxe, high-dpi screens and maybe someday MacOS support.

As an active member of [Silex Labs](https://www.silexlabs.org/) **Jean-Baptiste Richardet** is dedicated to make the community grow, convinced it will lead to a brighter future. He will tell us in his lightning talk **“Haxe Evangelism with Silex Labs”** what his dedication involved, including teaching students, making demos in front of professionals and creating bridges between open-source communities.

With a very strong current focus on the Gaming industry, Haxe remains unknown outside of that inner circle. App developers outside of that industry lack important foundations to let them approach the Haxe environment, and the Haxe ecosystem remains a bit too unclear to them. **Daniel Glazman **willl explain his views in the talk **“[Quaxe](http://quaxe.org/), infinity and beyond”**, almost with an external eye, of the situation and how it could be fixed.

Want to know why a UI library is important for a community? Then **Nickolay Grebenshikov**'s lightning talk


Following on user interface **Alfred Barberena** in the lightning talk **“Haxe in the






If you are using [Lime/OpenFL](https://github.com/openfl/lime) then this next talk should be of primary interest to you, **“Lime/OpenFL for home game consoles”**. **Lars Doucet** will show you a cross-platform, home game console backend for Lime/OpenFL, which will bring compatibility for WiiU, XBox One, PS4, PSVita, 3DS, etc. And if you are using an other Haxe framework this talk will also have valuable information if you want to add console compatibility.







But Haxe isn't just useful for making games, in **“Haxe for the
Web: Getting things done”** **Juraj Kirchheim** will show how Haxe can be used not only for complex long term projects, but also for quick and dirty prototypes and rapid application development. A pragmatic approach to Haxe based web development, particularly on the client side.

Why choose between the client site and the server side, most web-apps need a

Haxe: Using Ufront to build apps that work client side or server side”**.





**David Elahee** will present in
**“Drakarnage: Slapping data from web servers right in your GPU”** the data flow of drakarnage alongside some sample of what Haxe can achieve. The data flow is interesting because ultimately they have a pretty long roundtrip longing from sql, mongo, siding by redis and going back to a custom HTML renderer optimised for mobile GPU's.



[**Massive Interactive**](http://www.massiveinteractive.com/) was convinced and in the lightning talk **“Haxe at Massive Scale” David Peek** will present a whirlwind tour of the clients, platforms and devices where they are leveraging the awesome power of Haxe, and some of the problems they've solved in getting there.
