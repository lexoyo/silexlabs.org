The Like Box is a social plugin that enables Facebook Page owners to attract and gain Likes from their own website.

It works only with fan pages (no profil, no group possible).

**The Like Box enables users to:**




  * See how many users already like this Page, and which of their friends like it too


  * Read recent posts from the Page


  * Like the Page with one click, without needing to visit the Page.




### Installation


To use this plugin, you must first install it on your silex server  and then activate it for your publication or for the entire server.

Add it to your publication by clicking on "add component" ; you will find the social facebook frame widget in the "Frame" list. Just select it and click on "import".

### Use


To use the social facebook frame widget, you must create a fan page if you haven't one.

To do so, connect to your facebook account. At the bottom of the page you will find "create a page" option. Click on it.

Select your category. Once your page created, go back to your facebook home account and click on your page's name.
