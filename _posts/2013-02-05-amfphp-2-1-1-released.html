<p>Silex Labs is as always proud to present the latest and greatest version of AmfPHP, <strong>AmfPHP 2.1.1</strong>. AmfPHP 2.1 Generator was a big step forward, and this release is full of improvements building on that foundation.</p>
<p>Here are the main changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>Service Browser</strong> has been <strong>reworked</strong> to allow you to better work with your services and your data. There are now multiple ways to view data, and scrolling has been reduced to a minimum.</li>
<li>A brand new<strong> Flex Client Generator</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>Backoffice</strong> can now be put <strong>onlineÂ </strong>as it is by default <strong>login protected</strong></li>
<li>An <strong>example</strong> for <strong>Authentification services.<br />
</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to the community for its continued support!</p>
<p>The Silex Labs team.</p>
