Silex Labs is proud to release the latest and greatest version of amfPHP.  A few months after the much awaited 2.0, we've worked hard to make the experience of our users even better.

A lot of work has been put into reworking and completing the documentation. We've particularly worked on documenting the [plugins distributed with amfPHP](https://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/documentation/plugins/plugins-distributed-with-amfphp/). We've also reviewed our [troubleshooting tips](https://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/documentation/troubleshooting-and-debugging-your-project/), and added more info about [optimizing amfPHP](https://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/documentation/optimizing-amfphp/). Those are just the highlights, so please take another look around, and of course if you still feel that something is missing, please let us know!

We've also worked on making amfPHP more flexible and extensible. Some people have started working on third party plugins, and we want more, so this should make your life easier. We've made many changes under the hood to make things faster, more stable, and more secure.

We'd like to give a big thank you to the community for their support, feedback and ideas. Even those who were rude!

The download page is here: [https://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/downloads/](https://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/downloads/)
