## All they think about Silex !


Few weeks ago, Silex Labs launched a survey among Silex’s users.

The goal: see **what users like in Silex and what is missing**?

**We had been both surprised and consolidated in our choices : the Wysiwyg and the plugin system was a great success ; some revolutionary features had been requested ; an interesting survey for Silex's future.**

This kind of survey can help for the software’s development and promotes development in harmony with the community.
In that way, you can clearly visualize your main strengths and your weak points.

Here the items we focused on:




  * **Silex’s best features**


  * **Points to improve**


  * **Silex’s wanted features**


  * **The must among plugins & components**
