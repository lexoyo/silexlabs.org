We all understand the power, reach and potential of Haxe as a language and a development platform. Clearly communicating these strengths to your organisation and clients is vital to the growth and success of the platform. To the ears of decision makers, Haxe sounds like risk. Just another “write once, run anywhere” pipe dream they’ve never heard of that will cost them time and money. As ambassadors to this new world we take on the responsibility of first contact – introducing, educating and convincing them on the strengths and weaknesses of Haxe. Showing them the light.
