Use [XLSsynchro](http://wp-manager.silex-ria.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/xlssynchro2.zip) as a backoffice tool to dynamise your Silex Sites content associated to the ExcelComponent for front office part.

[XLSsynchro](http://wp-manager.silex-ria.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/xlssynchro2.zip) to allow the end user to upload easily an XLS file to his hosting server.
This tool is an ODS file (Open Office CALC) that contains a macro which generates a XLS
file and sends it to a server by FTP through DOS Commands (windows version).
The aim is to dynamise a part of a Silex Website allowing a client to change data himself.
The Oof Excel Plugin for Silex has to be added to the Silex Website in order to retrieve data
from the XLS file sent.
