The blog
--------

The SilexLabs blog is an initiative from the Silex team with one aim
: to express ourselves and share our experiences, discoveries and stories during this month of may and beyond.

The Silex Labs blog is a collection of points of view (…) concerning Silex, the Web, the software world, graphic design, Open Source projects (…)

We’ll refine the topics raised in this blog as we go along…

The organization
----------------

The Silex team members have decided to formalize theire cooperation by creating a non profit organization for the promotion, support for deployment and the development of open source software projects SILEX and Open Source Flash related.

The goal is to promote the software and its related projects nationally and internationally. We are an official training center with a state accreditation, and the maintainer for Silex and amfPhp projects.

Thanks for your support !
