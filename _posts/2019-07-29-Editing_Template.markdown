excerpt: I Spent time editing the Visicard Template now two days later I can't get
  into to it. The split screen button is not there anymore, I do not know how to get
  it back. I saved a file (so I thought) with a different name but can not find it
  anymore.  I am running the portable server. Any idea of what happened to the editor.
