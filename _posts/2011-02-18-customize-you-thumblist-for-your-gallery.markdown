### Step 2 : Modify your ThumbList with Flash


_Note :_ for precautions, it's better to save a copy of the original ThumbList.fla




  * Open your ThumbList.fla in Flash


  * Select the "ThumbCellRenderer" in the library

  * A pop-up opens ; browse into your files and choose your customized Thumblist (here named MyNewThumblist"


  * A message "File upload complete" appears


  * You can now choose your thumblist in the menu and click on "import"
