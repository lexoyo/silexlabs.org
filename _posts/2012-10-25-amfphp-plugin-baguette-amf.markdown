# How does it work?


				AMF is a very compact binary format. It is however difficult to parse. AmfPHP on its own does a good job, but it takes time, as it is [written in PHP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php). Baguette AMF is [written in C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29), and therefore enjoys native performance. This means up to 20 times faster conversion times.

				Baguette AMF is a product by [Ariel Sommeria-Klein](http://arielsommeria.com/blog/), team lead for [AmfPHP.](http://silexlabs.org/amfphp/)
