<p><strong>AMFPHP</strong> is back! A new team has come together to get the project moving again.</p>
<p><strong>What?</strong><br />
AMFPHP is the best way for Flash to communicate with your PHP code. It understands the AMF data sent and received by Flash, and translates it into something your PHP code can work with. AMF allows for binary serialization of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actionscript" target="_blank">Action Script</a> (AS2, AS3) native types and objects to be sent to server side services.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong><br />
It is a critical component in a number of projects, so we decided to revive it. Many CMS can integrate with AMFPHP. Check <a href="http://www.amfphp.org/frameworks.html">http://www.amfphp.org/frameworks.html</a></p>
