This plugin adds a service called SommeriaSearchService to amfPHP. The idea is to be able to access the API of various search engines through this plugin.

Currently there is only one search engine supported, Twitter. Call the 'searchTwitter' method on the 'SommeriaSearchService' service, and pass a query, for example 'amfphp'.

To install, simply download the zip from [here](http://arielsommeria.com/dev/SommeriaSearch.zip), unzip and drop the SommeriaSearch folder in amfPHP's plugins folder.

[The Twitter API is documented here.](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/using-search)
