From now on the best way to get support with amfPHP is right
here: 


The reason for the switch is that the Silex Labs platform that powers the website is now stable and powerful enough to handle this and provide a better experience for our users.



The [forums](http://sourceforge.net/projects/amfphp/forums) on Sourceforge are still open, simply because there doesn't seem to be a way to disable them without making them disappear. This would be a pity as there is a lot of knowledge there for those who care to look. But but but, please post here from now on!
