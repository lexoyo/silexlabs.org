The gallery has the following parameters
: 
### Pictures URLs

(ex: "media/logosilex.jpg") or from another website


### Autoplay

If the autoplay checkbox is checked, the picture will automatically be switched every few seconds. You can specify the interval with the "Autoplay duration" parameter.

### Autoplay duration

The interval in seconds before displaying the next picture, if the autoplay is activated.

### Loop

If the loop checkbox is checked, once the user reaches the last picture, if he clicks the next button, the first picture will be displayed, same for the first picture with the previous button.

### Transition Type

Determine the transition animation between 2 pictures, here are the current transitions types
: 
*   Fade
*   Swipe
*   Zoom

### Transition duration

The duration of the transition between 2 pictures in seconds.

### Show controls

### Scale mode

: 
*   #### noscale
    
    The picture won't be resized and will be displayed at their full size
    
*   #### fill
    
    The picture will take the dimensions of the gallery. It will probably deform the picture
    
*   #### exactFit
    
    The picture will take the biggest size they can within the gallery without being deformed

Skinning the gallery
--------------------

The simple gallery is a skinnable component, you can download the source FLA here
: [SimpleGallery_source](https://www.silexlabs.org/?attachment_id=86570). This FLA allows to create your own design by customising
: 
*   The next button
*   the previous button
*   the loader displayed when a picture is loading
*   the error panel displayed when a picture was not found

The folder "silex framework" in the Flash library contain all the necessary clips to make the gallery work as a Silex component and shouldn't be changed. The "gallery asset" folder contains some graphics which can be customised.

Controlling the gallery with actions
------------------------------------

You can use any component to act as the next and previous button of your gallery by adding an action to them.

Ex
: for a simple gallery called "myGallery".

Add the following action on the component yout want to use as the next button
: 
`onRelease myGallery.next`

Add the following action on the component yout want to use as the previous button
: 
`onRelease myGallery.previous`
