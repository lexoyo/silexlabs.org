The Pixlr plugin for Silex, makes it possible to edit your website's images directly from the browser. It uses [Pixlr](http://pixlr.com/) free online service, without registration.

You will not have to leave your browser anymore to make Silex websites. Pixlr opens in a new window and let you edit the images of your Silex library. It is possible to draw by hand, to edit image properties, to apply effects, to crop, ... Just like a photoshop online, beside your Silex server!

Please consider this is the first version of the plugin, it is still in beta version. Please [report bugs here](http://code.google.com/p/pixlr-for-silex/issues/list).
