If you didn’t already know about this, Silex Labs organized the World Wide Haxe Conference 2015 aka WWX2015, the international conference on [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) the free cross-platform language from the 29th May to the 1st of June 2015.

We’d like to thanks once again [Mozilla Paris](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/spaces/paris/) for hosting us so well in his magnificent building, symbol of the free software development!

The WWX2015 brought together about 100 participants from 17 countries for 4 days of conferences and workshops and the famous Silex Labs festive evenings.

More than 1500 people followed the live stream of the conference on air.mozilla.org and on the official website [wwx.silexlabs.org](http://wwx.silexlabs.org/). All of these people didn’t just sit there and watch, they also shout to the world their love for Haxe, with nearly 1800 tweets between Saturday and Sunday and a lot of photos. A true great community!

Aside from the official talks and workshops, it was a great opportunity to create interactions between the members of the community by visiting paris, partying in a french bistro and having a croissant with your coffee every morning.

### **WWX2016?**


Do you like Haxe, the WWX and the world of open source? Your help is always welcome!

Regarding the success of the crowd funding campaign we are going to do it again in order to fund this haxeptionnal event. We are open to your suggestions to enable us to continue to organize this event, which seems so important to the Haxe community. Next year, we’d like to include all of the good wills sooner so they’ll have a chance to bring new ideas from the beginning.


### **Special thanks**


It would looks like oscars’ speech but we have thousands thanks to do to all the people who took time helping us for the organisation of the WWX2015.

To organize this conference, Silex Labs has united its most motivated Haxe members to form a working group: the “THaxe Force”! Among it we find the President of Silex Labs[, Alex Hoyau](https://twitter.com/lexoyo), co-founder[ Pol Goasdoué](https://twitter.com/superwup) and a whole lot of Haxe developers like[ Clément Charmet](https://twitter.com/clemenchar), [Jean-Baptiste Richardet](https://twitter.com/JbIPS), [Thomas Fétiveau](https://twitter.com/zab0jad) and[ Ariel Sommeria Klein](https://twitter.com/arielsom). These volunteers have donated their time to prepare for this conference since October 2014. Antonin Stephany, project manager at Silex Labs, hosted the working group to ensure that this swarm of ideas was put to good use.



Our thanks goes out to the speakers and all the participants for their motivation and collaboration too!

Of course we’d like to thanks Nicolas Silva our Mozilla’s sponsor who have been of great help all along the weekend.

Special thanks for the communication and visual design to[ Pol Goasdoué](https://fr.linkedin.com/pub/pol-goasdou%C3%A9/19/87b/616), Nicolas Masson and Emmanuel Waras.

Another one to Bruno Celada, our professional photograph who cover the event for us,  © KEP, you can contact him at paraphe [at] paraphe [dot] fr

and [Scengrafics](http://www.scengrafics.com/) for their saturday night animations.



A big thanks also to the Silex Labs’ staff for helping us for the installation, for welcoming people, taking pictures ...
