From now on the best way to get support with amfPHP is right here:

[https://www.silexlabs.org/groups/amfphp/amfphp-users/forum/](https://www.silexlabs.org/groups/amfphp/amfphp-users/forum/)

The reason for the switch is that the Silex Labs platform that powers the website is now stable and powerful enough to handle this and provide a better experience for our users.

As team lead for amfPHP I'd like to take this opportunity to give thanks to [@camille](https://www.silexlabs.org/members/camille/), [@pol](https://www.silexlabs.org/members/pol/) and [@lexa](https://www.silexlabs.org/members/lexa/) for their hard work in putting together the Silex Labs website platform. I'd also like to thank everyone who ever answered a bewildered user's plea for help on the Sourceforge forums!

The [forums](http://sourceforge.net/projects/amfphp/forums) on Sourceforge are still open, simply because there doesn't seem to be a way to disable them without making them disappear. This would be a pity as there is a lot of knowledge there for those who care to look. But but but, please post here from now on!
