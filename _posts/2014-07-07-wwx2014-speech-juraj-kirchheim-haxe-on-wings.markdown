## JURAJ KIRCHHEIM




### Freelancer




In the fall of 2008, after an arduous odyssey to find the perfect programming language, Juraj found himself stranded on the miraculous island of Haxe. Once a flash developer he recently shifted his platform focus to Haxe/js both on server and client side. He loves writing Haxe code and hates writing biographies. Because unfortunately, there is no macro for that. Who would know than him?





## Tinkerbell - Haxe on Wings




The Tinkerbell project has been around for almost three years now, pushing all of Haxe's new features to the limit. We'll explore just what that really means in practice. Short lambdas are only the start!








# Video


We had some problem with the beginning of the video, so we asked Hugh to make a screencast after the WWX2014 for the first slides (4min).
