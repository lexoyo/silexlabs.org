<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Tuesday pic !</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">First, welcome to 10th Silex-Labs member, DRUGBOX, a developer from Leipzig, Germany ! He's been with us in the office since monday.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">ATHANASE seems happy eating his sandwich from Chez Goodies, the weather is not so bad, the conversation goes from programming to men-women relationships, PASCAL's smoking habit and finally, ARIEL made us all laugh while eating his half-smashed and not so much yellow banana, covered with bread flour.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What else happened ?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">OoOoOooh I know !</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">When I arrived this morning, the Big Boss, a.k.a Lex, was wearing a striped shirt, fancy black shoes and brown tuxedo pants instead of his usual geeky tees and slacks ;D</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Hmm... It could only mean one thing guys :</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Appointments ! Appointments ! Appointments !</p>
