The 4th International Haxe Conference - WWX2014
-----------------------------------------------

From 23th to 26th may 2014

The event is intended for Haxe developers to meet, learn and show new technologies. The conference will involve talks from core developers and community members.

[Visit the WWX2014 website](http://wwx.silexlabs.org/2014 "WWX2014")

Meet the Community
------------------

[Just like last year](https://www.silexlabs.org/140165/the-blog/wwx2013-was-haxeptional-thanks-to-you-all/), it will bring together a bunch of very savvy developers who maintain the Haxe compiler and the core Haxe programming language. And also the most talented and forward-thinking web, application and game developers.

It is the best chance to meet and develop connections for future collaborations, and also to exhibit Haxe projects and technologies.

[Remember wwx2013](https://www.silexlabs.org/140165/the-blog/wwx2013-was-haxeptional-thanks-to-you-all/)

Register Now!! Places are Limited
