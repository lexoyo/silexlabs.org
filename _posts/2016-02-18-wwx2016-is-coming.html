<p>The WWX is the annual meet-up for the developers of the Haxe community, during this event you will have the opportunity to discover the latest Haxe's innovations and strategy. This event provides you with an unmatched platform to meet, network and share knowledge on Haxe.</p>
<p>The website is now live at <a href="http://wwx.silexlabs.org/" target="_blank">http://wwx.silexlabs.org/</a> continuing on the spirit of not changing what's not broken we'll also do a crowd-funding campaign this year, which will start on March the 8th at 12h00 PM UTC, giving you the opportunity to register. Although it's not the exact same, we've simplified the rewards ;)<br />
