Silex Labs is as always proud to present the latest and greatest version of AmfPHP, **AmfPHP 2.1.1**. AmfPHP 2.1 Generator was a big step forward, and this release is full of improvements building on that foundation.

Here are the main changes:




  * The **Service Browser** has been **reworked** to allow you to better work with your services and your data. There are now multiple ways to view data, and scrolling has been reduced to a minimum.


  * A brand new** Flex Client Generator**


  * The **Backoffice** can now be put **onlineÂ **as it is by default **login protected**


  * An **example** for **Authentification services.
**


Many thanks to the community for its continued support!

The Silex Labs team.
