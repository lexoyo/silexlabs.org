When you will need to program UIs in [Haxe](http://haxe.org/), then you might need a [Cocktail](http://haxe.org/com/libs/cocktail?lang=en) !

With one code base you will be able to manipulate the DOM and deploy liquid layouts on all platforms supported by haXe. [Cocktail](http://haxe.org/com/libs/cocktail) is also a good complement of [NME](http://www.haxenme.org/).

Since the announcement of an abstraction layer last year, we have released the first version of this haXe library, and we have a better understanding of where we want to go. We will enjoy talking about our goals, strategy and progress.
