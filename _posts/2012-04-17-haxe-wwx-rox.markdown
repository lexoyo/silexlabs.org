It was awesome! And it's over. We should do it again :-)

				The [WWX Haxe conference](http://wwx.haxe.org/) just finished. [Silex Labs](http://silexlabs.org/silexlabs/) is very proud to have organized it, as it gave us the opportunity to bring together wonderful people from all over the world to talk about one of our favourite subjects: [Haxe](http://haxe.org/).

				The conference was sold out, so it goes to show that Haxe has incredible momentum. There were people from France of course, and also Australia, New Zealand, USA, Brazil, Canada, Hungary, Germany, Netherlands, UK, and Italy. The variety of applications they are working on with Haxe was equally mind blowing:  web, mobile, games, artistic installations, presentation software.

				You would have thought it was only about code. You would have been wrong! There were presentations about business, marketing, and art, all with a Haxe twist. And yes, lots and lots of code. Silex Labs and the Haxe community would like to thank the people who put in the time and energy to make such good presentations.
