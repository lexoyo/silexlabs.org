**Hugh Sanderson** presented at the WWX2015 **“Hxcpp : State of the <del>union</del> enum”**. This talk takes a tour though the current state and future directions of the hxcpp target.  There are been quite a few juicy changes in the C++ backend over the past year.  With tighter native integration for the more nerdy developer and better scripting integration for the not-quite-so-nerdy developer, there should be something in talk for everyone.

Hugh Sanderson: "I had a fantastic time at wwx this year - great to see some new faces and some old ones.  I think I talked to most people at some stage and found the diversity of ideas and uses for haxe very inspiring".
