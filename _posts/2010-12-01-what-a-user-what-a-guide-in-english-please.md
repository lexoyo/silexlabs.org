After two weeks of work, The Masked Koala has translated the French User Guide of Silex into English, for your convenience!

Right now, you can learn Silex  


This documentation will let you discover a lot of things that you do not expect I guess

*   Installation
*   Manager
*   Wysiwyg
*   Text editor
*   Actions and Accessors
*   Customize your Silex
*   OOF

And for the developers, you will find technical documentation in the codex





Best,  
Silex Labs team.
