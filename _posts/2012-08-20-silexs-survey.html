<h2>All they think about Silex !</h2>
<p>Few weeks ago, Silex Labs launched a survey among Silex’s users.</p>
<p>The goal: see <strong>what users like in Silex and what is missing</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>We had been both surprised and consolidated in our choices : the Wysiwyg and the plugin system was a great success ; some revolutionary features had been requested ; an interesting survey for Silex's future.</strong></p>
<h3><a href="http://blog.arvixe.com/silexs-survey/" target="_blank">Discover by yourself</a> !</h3>
<p>This kind of survey can help for the software’s development and promotes development in harmony with the community.<br />
In that way, you can clearly visualize your main strengths and your weak points.</p>
<p>Here the items we focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Silex’s best features</strong></li>
<li><strong>Points to improve</strong></li>
<li><strong>Silex’s wanted features</strong></li>
<li><strong>The must among plugins &amp; components</strong></li>
</ul>
