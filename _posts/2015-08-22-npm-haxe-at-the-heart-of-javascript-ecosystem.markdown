**David Mouton** presents **“NPM, Haxe at the heart of Javascript ecosystem”.** Javascript ecosystem for web app development is well implanted and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) is at the centre of it. [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) are perfectly integrated and have offered a real alternative to full Javascript development. For almost a year now, Haxe has constituted a third alternative in this ecosystem.

In his talk David explains why Haxe is a very relevant option. He introduces its current state of integration, fonctionning and evolutions to come.

focus : web applications development
