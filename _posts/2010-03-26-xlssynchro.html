  Description: |-
    Use XLSSynchro to allow the end user to upload easily an XLS file to his hosting server.
    This tool is an ODS file (Open Office CALC) that contains a macro which generates a XLS
    file and sends it to a server by FTP through DOS Commands (windows version).
    The aim is to dynamise a part of a Silex Website allowing a client to change data himself.
    The Oof Excel Plugin for Silex has to be added to the Silex Website in order to retrieve data
    from the XLS file sent.
