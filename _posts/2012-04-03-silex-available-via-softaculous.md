We are proud to announce that Silex is finally available via [Softaculous](http://www.softaculous.com/softwares/cms/Silex). Softaculous is an auto-installer for web hosts, and if your host uses it, it means that Silex can be installed with just one click via their admin panel!

They have a page for Silex


Thanks to Softaculous, using Silex has become even easier!

They also have a list of partners here, where you can find hosts that use Softaculous.
