: 
*   **grid step :** the step of the grid, the size of the grid square increases with the step
*   **snap step :** the zone of snap around the grid. The bigger it is, the farther a component can be from an intersection and still be snapped.
*   **grid color :** the color of the grid. Might be useful to change based on you publication background color.
*   **grid alpha :** the transparency of the grid, from 0 to 100.
