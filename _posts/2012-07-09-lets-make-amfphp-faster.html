<p>A few months ago we added a feedback form for amfPHP to the website. <a href="https://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/feedback/">https://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/feedback/</a> Thanks to everyone who answered. Please keep it coming! The most popular feature request is "c extension for AMF, allowing much better performance".</p>
<p>This is a big project, and needs to be financed. One option that is being considered is to make this a commercial project, outside of Silex Labs. AmfPHP would still work as is, but when you need a speed boost because a lot of people are using your app, you would have the option of buying this lib to increase performance.</p>
<p>Before starting work, we would appreciate some feedback from our users.</p>
<ul>
<li>Would you be interested?</li>
<li>How much would you be willing to pay for it? On What terms?</li>
<li>We're considering the creation of a <a href="www.kickstarter.com">kickstarter </a>project for it. Is that a good idea?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get back to us on this using the feedback form here <a href="https://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/feedback/">https://www.silexlabs.org/amfphp/feedback/</a>, or by mail at contact at silexlabs dot org.  And please comment!</p>
